<h1>ðŸš€ CRUD Application</h1> <h2>- User Management</h2>
<p>Iâ€™ve built a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) app that allows users to add their first name, last name, email, and password. The app saves this data and displays it in a table. It also features Edit and Delete buttons for easy management of user details.</p>
